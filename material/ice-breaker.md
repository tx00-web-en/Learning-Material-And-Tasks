# Icebreaker Instructions
 
## Step 1: Pair Discussion (2 per pair):

- **Goal**: Break the ice + learn background
- Turn to the person sitting next to you (same row).
- Discuss these questions:
  1. What’s one thing in your background (studies, hobbies, jobs) that connects to web or tech?
  2. Which programming language / framework are you most comfortable with — or most curious to learn?
  3. Have you ever built something you were proud of (technical or not)?
  4. If you could build any app tomorrow, what would it do?
  5. What role do you usually take in a team (organizer, coder, designer, motivator, tester)?  
- (7 minutes → each person speaks for about 3 minutes, keep it balanced)

## Step 2: Group of Four 
- **Goal**: Explore project interests + AI use → helps future group formation
- Turn around to connect with the row behind you.
- Form a group of 4 (two pairs together).
- Discuss these questions:
  1. Which type of project excites you most? Startup-style product (innovation), Practical app (e.g., e-commerce, job board), AI-powered assistant/tool, Creative project (games, art, media)
  2. How do you imagine AI helping in projects — as a tool (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) or as a feature (integrated into the product)?
  3. What’s one skill you bring to a group (technical, creative, communication) — and one skill you’d like to learn from others?
  4. Imagine your group is pitching a project in 2 months — what’s the one sentence you’d like to say about it?
  5. What’s the biggest challenge you think we’ll face in this course, and how can a group overcome it?
- (10 minutes → give everyone a chance to speak briefly)
