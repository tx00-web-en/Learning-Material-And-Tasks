## Session 2

###  What is Full-Stack Development?
- Full-stack development is about mastering both the frontend and backend components of web applications.
- As a full-stack developer, you'll be capable of handling the entire development process, from designing the user interface to managing databases and server-side logic.
- We'll discuss the benefits of being a full-stack developer and understand the "big picture."

### What is MERN and the Role of Each Technology in the Stack:
- MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
- We'll delve into the role of each technology:
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data.
  - Express.js: A backend framework for building robust APIs.
  - React: A library for building interactive user interfaces.
  - Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.

###  Another Perspective:

- **Backend:** [Roadmap BE]

  - In the backend part of full-stack development, we work with technologies like Node.js on the server side. This involves handling server-side logic, managing databases, and processing data.
  - Security is a critical concern in the backend, although we'll delve into this aspect further as the course progresses. We'll explore how to secure our applications from potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
- **Frontend:** [Roadmap FE]
  - On the frontend side, we begin by understanding the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of web pages in a tree-like format. This understanding is essential for manipulating and interacting with web page elements.
  - We'll explore the concept of the Virtual DOM, a technique used by frameworks like React to optimize updates and enhance performance.
  - We'll start from the very basics of frontend development, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their prior experience, gains a strong foundation.
- **API (REST) + Documentation:**
  - APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are crucial for enabling communication between different parts of an application or between different applications. We'll focus on RESTful APIs, a common approach for building web services.
  - Documentation plays a key role in ensuring that developers can understand and use APIs effectively. We'll cover how to design clear and user-friendly API documentation.
- **DevOps:**
  - DevOps practices emphasize collaboration and integration between development and IT operations teams. We'll touch upon the importance of DevOps in the software development lifecycle.
- **Testing:**
  - Testing is a critical aspect of software development to ensure the reliability and quality of your code. We'll explore different types of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
- **Security:**
  - Security is a paramount concern in modern web applications. While we won't delve deeply into security considerations at this point, we'll touch upon its importance. Later in the course, we'll explore how to identify potential security vulnerabilities and implement best practices.
- **AI**  
- Where to go next? (e.g Nextjs, GraphQL)

**4. Advantages of Using MERN for Building Web Applications:**
- We'll explore the advantages of the MERN stack, such as:
  - Seamless integration of technologies using JavaScript.
  - Reusable components for efficient development.
  - Rapid development and scalability.
  - Building real-time applications.
- Hands on Project: 
  - Prototyping (low vs high fidelity)
  - Scrum, Sprints

### HOW

- We'll adopt a balanced approach:
  - **1 foot in industry:** Real-world applications and practical skills: [Scrimba], [Freecodecamp], [Traversy Media]
  - **1 foot academia:** A solid foundation in theories and concepts.
  <!-- : [Full Stack open] -->

### Teaching Method:
  - Straightforward assignments to illustrate single concepts.
  - Mini projects during homework or in project sessions.
  - Independent study to explore additional topics like Flexbox and Figma.
  - Optional Independent study for advanced concepts like Material UI.
  - Modern JavaScript concepts will be introduced just-in-time to manage complexity.

### Interactive Learning:
  - Group work and pair programming for collaborative learning.
  - You can use ChatGPT during class for assistance (not during the exam).

### Deliverables:
  - Reflection journal to track your progress and insights.
  - In-class activities to reinforce learning.
  - Three sprints for the project, each lasting two weeks.
  - We'll discuss the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the project in detail later.

## Session 3


### Group Formation

- Collaborative work is a cornerstone of successful software development.
- For the course project, we'll be forming groups with a maximum of 4 students in each.
- Working in groups offers you the opportunity to learn from your peers, share ideas, and create projects that are more diverse and well-rounded.

### [Unified Setup](./unified-setup.md)

A unified setup ensures that we're all on the same page and can move forward seamlessly in our learning journey.

#### Browser: Firefox or Chrome

- We recommend using Firefox or Chrome as your web browsers for development work.
- These browsers come equipped with excellent developer tools that will greatly assist you in building and debugging your applications effectively.

#### Node.js LTS (Long-Term Support)

- Node.js is a fundamental tool for building server-side applications and working with JavaScript on the backend.
- We'll be utilizing the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version to ensure stability and compatibility with the tools and libraries we'll be using throughout the course.

#### VSCode (Visual Studio Code)

- VSCode is a powerful and widely adopted code editor that enhances productivity and supports a wide range of programming languages.
- It will be our primary tool for writing code and managing our projects efficiently.

#### Git

- Git, the version control system, is a linchpin for collaborative development and project management.
- Throughout the course, we'll utilize Git to track changes in our code, collaborate on projects, and manage our codebase effectively.
