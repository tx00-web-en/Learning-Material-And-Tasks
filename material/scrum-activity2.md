* Effective collaboration within your team is essential for success.
* Apply critical thinking when defining and prioritizing **user stories**.
* Reflect on how Scrum principles apply to your planning.
* Distribute tasks by balancing individual strengths with opportunities for growth. 

**Expected Outcomes (by the end of Sprint 1 planning):**

* A clear **project idea** chosen by your group.
* An initial **Product Backlog** with user stories written.
* Established **Scrum roles**: decide who will serve as Product Owner and Scrum Master.
