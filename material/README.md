  - [MERN Stack Crash Course Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE): Videos 1-7 serve as a review of backend concepts, while videos 8-10 focus on connecting the React app to the backend.
  - [Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/MERN-Stack-Tutorial): Use this repository as a reference.

### Friday Afternoon (16:30 - 19:30):

We’ll have an optional Q&A session. This session is open to all students. If you’d like to schedule a private session (~30 minutes), please let me know in advance.
