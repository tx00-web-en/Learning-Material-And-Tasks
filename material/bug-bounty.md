    > In the code examples, both the variable x and the function helloWorld are hoisted. During hoisting, the variable x is declared and initialized with undefined, but its assignment happens later in the code. The helloWorld function is fully hoisted, allowing you to call it before its declaration. However, since x is not assigned a value during hoisting, any operation involving x before its assignment will result in undefined, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Reordering the code ensures that variables like x are assigned before they are used.
