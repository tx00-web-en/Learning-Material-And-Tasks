# Important

Thank you for the strong efforts this week. Many of you are doing excellent work, and I want us all to maintain the same high standards. To keep things fair and consistent, we must follow the rules of pair programming and assignment submission carefully.  

To support this, each group will review the checklist below together. Once you’ve discussed all points, please submit the following statement to OMA:

> *We, [member 1], [member 2], [member 3], [member 4], confirm that we have reviewed all checklist items and accept full responsibility for compliance.*

### 3. Pair Programming
- **Method:** Must follow **Strong‑Style Pair Programming**. [Read more here](./about-pair-prog.md).  
- **Alternating commits:** Both members must alternate iterations.  
  - Example: Iteration 1 – Member 1, Iteration 2 – Member 2, Iteration 3 – Member 1, Iteration 4 – Member 2, etc.  
- **Evidence:**  
  - After each iteration, take a **screenshot** of the pushed commit on GitHub.  
  - Screenshot must show both the **commit message** and the **user who made the commit**.  
  - Save all screenshots in a folder named **`screenshots`** inside your repository.  
- **Tools:** You may use **Live Share** in VS Code to collaborate, but commits must still alternate.  
- **Important:** If only one member makes all commits, it will **not** be considered pair programming.

## Consequences
If any member of the class does not abide by these rules, incomplete work will be replaced with a **paper exam**.

## Closing Note
