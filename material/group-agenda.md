### Agenda for Team Meeting

1. **Introductions and Skill Assessment**
   - Get to know each team member.
   - Discuss each member's skills, competencies, and areas to develop.

2. **Brainstorm Project Ideas**
   - Discuss and finalize the type of project the team will build.


3. **Establish Scrum Roles**
   - Decide who will serve as the Product Owner and Scrum Master:
     - The *Scrum Master role can rotate* with each Sprint.
     - The Product Owner should *ideally* remain consistent throughout the project.

4. **Task Assignment**
   - Assign tasks based on individual strengths and development goals:
     - One member to focus on reviewing `CSS` skills, particularly media queries and flexbox. Here's a very good resource [available](https://metropolia.finna.fi/Record/nelli15.5680000000060713?sid=4846325380) at Metropolia's Library.
     - One or two members to work with `Figma`. Here's a very good resource [available](https://metropolia.finna.fi/Record/nelli15.5850000000052946?sid=4846325074) at Metropolia's Library.
     - Another member to manage `Trello` for project coordination and product/sprint backlog and user stories.
     - Feel free to use your favorite LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bing Copilot etc.) to refine the agenda items and brainstorm project ideas.
