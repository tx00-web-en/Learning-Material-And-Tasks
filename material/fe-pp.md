# Pair Programming: Front end

The [pair programming task](./fe-pp-current.md) will become visible once we start the session. In the meantime, you are strongly encouraged to review a task from a [previous period](./fe-pp-old.md). This session’s pair programming activity will be **similar, though not identical**, and reflecting on earlier work will help you make the most of ypur time together.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Review the group activities, watch the pre‑session video, and revisit the task from the **previous period**.  
> - [Read about Strong‑Style Pair Programming](./about-pair-prog.md).  
> - For the pair programming to be accepted, **both members must alternate iterations.**  
> - Example:* Iteration 1 – Member 1, Iteration 2 – Member 2, Iteration 3 – Member 1, Iteration 4 – Member 2, and so on.  
>   - *Note:* All commits will be graded separately.  
> - After each iteration, take a **screenshot** of the pushed commit on GitHub. The screenshot must clearly show both the **commit message** and the **user who made the commit**. Save all screenshots in a folder named **`screenshots`** within your repository.  
> - You may use the **Live Share** extension in VS Code to facilitate collaboration. However, commits must still alternate between members. It will **not** be considered pair programming if only one member is making all the commits.
