# Use of AI in the course


### Principles for Using AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a valuable tool for enhancing your programming journey. While using AI to generate code is permitted, it's crucial to do so thoughtfully and responsibly.

1. **AI as a Complement:** AI-generated code should be viewed as a starting point, not a finished product. Always review, modify, and test the code to ensure it meets your specific requirements and adheres to best practices.
2. **Learning Through Understanding:** Use AI to explore different approaches, learn new techniques, and deepen your understanding of programming concepts. Focus on the underlying principles and logic rather than simply relying on AI-generated solutions.
3. **Transparency and Accountability:** Be prepared to explain how AI-generated code works. This not only demonstrates your understanding but also ensures you maintain academic integrity and avoid plagiarism.
