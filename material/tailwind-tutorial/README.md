### Next Steps

Consider refactoring the static landing page from Part 4 into a React application. If further guidance is needed, I can provide detailed instructions upon request.

1. **Create a New React Project and Integrate Tailwind CSS with React**:
      - Follow the Tailwind setup steps from Part 3 within this new React project to ensure Tailwind is available.

2. **Convert HTML Components to React Components**:
      - Split the landing page sections into reusable React components (e.g., `Header`, `Hero`, `Features`, `Footer`).
      - Copy the HTML structure from the landing page and convert it into JSX syntax, then place each section into a separate component.

3. **Organize the Project Structure**:
      - Place each component in the `src/components` folder for a clean structure.
