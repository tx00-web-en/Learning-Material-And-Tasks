<summary>To write HTML structure faster, you can use [Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/#id-and-class), a shorthand system for quickly generating HTML and CSS.  </summary>
For example:

```html
p#header.nav
.page
#footer.class1.class2.class3
```

...will expand to:

```html
<p id="header" class="nav"></p>
<div class="page"></div>
<div id="footer" class="class1 class2 class3"></div>

### Why Tailwind CSS? Differences from Bootstrap and Vanilla CSS

When choosing a CSS framework or library, developers often compare three main approaches: vanilla CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind.

- **Vanilla CSS**: Writing CSS without any framework gives complete control but can be time-consuming and challenging to maintain for complex UIs, especially when styling for responsiveness and theme consistency.
  
- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework offering ready-made UI components (buttons, navbars, grids, etc.) that are easy to use. However, customizing Bootstrap styles can be challenging if you want to break out of its predefined look.
  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind takes a unique approach by providing utility-first classes (e.g., `p-4` for padding, `text-center` for alignment) rather than pre-built components. This approach lets developers quickly style any element directly in HTML without needing custom CSS files. 

### Why Developers Love Tailwind

Tailwind’s utility classes make it a favorite among developers, even for those without UI experience:

- **Ease of Use**: Tailwind's classes are simple and descriptive, making it easy for developers to create complex layouts without needing in-depth CSS knowledge.
- **Consistency**: The predefined utility classes make it easy to maintain consistency across different sections of a project.
- **Flexibility**: Developers can mix and match classes to build any design without needing to override predefined component styles, as is common with frameworks like Bootstrap.

### Using Tailwind with Large Language Models (LLMs)

With Tailwind CSS’s descriptive classes, developers can even use large language models (LLMs) to generate HTML/CSS code based on descriptive prompts. For example, a prompt like *"use tailwind css to create a centered card with rounded corners, a heading, and a subscribe button"* can easily be translated into Tailwind classes, streamlining the development process for responsive and attractive UIs.

### Getting Started with Tailwind CSS from a CDN

To use Tailwind CSS quickly without setup, you can include it directly via a CDN link in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

This approach is perfect for smaller projects, quick prototypes, and when you want to experiment with Tailwind before setting up a full project. Part 3 will dive into using Tailwind with the CLI for custom configurations.

### Prerequisites: Understanding the CSS Box Model and Flexbox

Before starting with Tailwind, it’s helpful to understand the **CSS box model** and **Flexbox layout**. Here are some foundational concepts:

- **Padding (`p-*`)**: Padding adds space inside the border of an element, pushing its content inward.
  - Example: `p-4` adds a uniform padding of 1 rem (16px by default) around an element.
  
- **Margin (`m-*`)**: Margin creates space outside the element’s border, separating it from adjacent elements.
  - Example: `m-4` adds a uniform margin of 1 rem (16px) around an element.

- **Flexbox (`flex`, `items-center`, etc.)**: Flexbox is a CSS layout model that helps align items in a container. Tailwind uses `flex`, `items-center`, and `justify-center` to manage layouts effectively.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Building an Email Subscription Card with Tailwind CSS

Here's the [source code for this mini project](./html/part2.html) and here’s a breakdown of the HTML/CSS code for building a subscription card using Tailwind from a CDN.

#### 1. Basic HTML Structure

The code below creates an HTML file with Tailwind CDN included and an overall structure for a subscription card.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <title>Email Subscribe</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="flex items-center justify-center h-screen bg-zinc-700">
      <!-- Card structure here -->
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

- Background Container

```html
<div class="flex items-center justify-center h-screen bg-zinc-700">
```

This line creates a **full-screen centered container**. The `h-screen` class ensures the container covers the full viewport height, while `bg-zinc-700` sets a dark gray background color. `flex items-center justify-center` centers all content both vertically and horizontally.

colors from from 100 till 1000. You can review them [here](https://tailwindcolor.com/).

### 3. Card Container

```html
<div class="bg-zinc-800 p-2 mx-6 rounded-2xl">
```

The card container uses `bg-zinc-800` for a slightly darker background. `p-2` adds padding, `mx-6` provides horizontal margins, and `rounded-2xl` applies large rounded corners.

### 4. Flex Container

```html
<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row rounded-l-xl">
```

This container uses `flex` for a flexible layout. By default, it stacks elements vertically (`flex-col`), but on medium screens and above (`md:flex-row`), it arranges them in a row. The `rounded-l-xl` class rounds only the left corners, useful for a split design.

### 5. Image

```html
<img src="images/image.jpg" alt="" class="object-fit rounded-xl h-80 md:h-64 md:rounded-l-xl md:rounded-r-none transform hover:scale-105 hover:rounded-xl duration-200"/>
```

The image is styled with:
- `object-fit`: Ensures the image scales properly.
- `rounded-xl`: Rounds all corners.
- `h-80`: Sets a fixed height of 80 (20 rem), adapting to medium screens (`md:h-64`).
- `hover:scale-105 hover:rounded-xl duration-200`: On hover, the image slightly scales up (`scale-105`) and applies animation with `duration-200` for smooth transition.

### 6. Content Container

```html
<div class="p-6 md:p-12">
```

The content container provides padding of `p-6` (1.5 rem) on smaller screens and `p-12` (3 rem) on medium and larger screens.

### 7. Title

```html
<h2 class="font-serif text-xl font-medium text-center text-white md:text-left">
  Get diet and fitness tips in your inbox
</h2>
```

The title uses:
- `font-serif`: Sets a serif font style.
- `text-xl font-medium`: Controls font size and weight.
- `text-center text-white`: Centers text on smaller screens, switches to left alignment on medium screens (`md:text-left`).

### 8. Description

```html
<p class="max-w-xs my-4 text-xs leading-5 tracking-wide text-center text-white md:text-left">
  Eat better and exercise better. Sign up for the Diet&Fitness newsletter.
</p>
```

This description uses:
- `max-w-xs`: Limits width for readability.
- `my-4`: Adds vertical margin.
- `text-xs leading-5 tracking-wide`: Controls font size, line height, and letter spacing.

### 9. Email Input and Button

```html
<div class="flex flex-col mt-5 space-y-4 md:space-x-3 md:flex-row md:space-y-0">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your email address" class="p-2 px-4 text-center text-white bg-zinc-800 border border-zinc-600 placeholder:text-xs placeholder:text-center md:text-left focus:outline-none" />
  <button class="px-5 py-3 text-xs rounded-md text-zinc-800 bg-lime-500 hover:bg-lime-700 hover:text-white duration-500">
    Subscribe
  </button>
</div>
```

This section features:
- **Input Field**: Styled with `p-2 px-4` for padding, `text-center` for centered placeholder text, `bg-zinc-800` for background, and `border-zinc-600` for a border.
- **Button**: Styled with `px-5 py-3` padding, `text-xs`, `rounded-md` for rounded corners, `bg-lime-500` for background, and hover effects with a smooth transition.
