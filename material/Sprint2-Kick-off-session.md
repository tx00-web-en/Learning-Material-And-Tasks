# Task: Sprint 2 Kick-off Activities (Afternoon)

The goal of **Sprint 2 kick-off** session is to properly transition from Sprint 1 to Sprint 2 by reflecting on the previous sprint and planning the next sprint according to the Scrum framework.

This activity is **mandatory** and must be completed **today**.

---

## 1. Confirm Scrum Roles (Mandatory)

Each group must clearly identify and agree on the following roles:

### 1.1 Scrum Master

* One person must be identified as the **Scrum Master**.
* Due to small group sizes, the Scrum Master **is also a developer**.
* Responsibilities:

  * Facilitate all Scrum ceremonies:

    * Sprint Planning
    * Daily Scrum
    * Sprint Review
    * Sprint Retrospective
  * Ensure the **Sprint 1 Retrospective** is conducted today.
  * Ensure the **Sprint 2 Planning session** is completed today.
  * Log the team’s Scrum adoption **daily** (short entries).
  * Maintain Scrum-related documentation in GitHub.

---

### 1.2 Product Owner

* One person must be identified as the **Product Owner**.
* The Product Owner **is also a developer**.
* Responsibilities:

  * Own and maintain the **Product Backlog**.
  * Ensure that the **Sprint 2 Backlog** is derived from the Product Backlog.
  * If a Product Backlog does not exist, create one today.
  * Prioritize backlog items according to Sprint 2 deliverables and assessment criteria.
  * Maintain Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog documentation in GitHub.

---

### 1.3 UI/UX Responsibility

* One team member must take responsibility for **UI/UX decisions**.
* Responsibilities:

  * Decide which **CSS approach or library** will be used (e.g., Vanilla CSS, Tailwind, MUI).
  * Ensure consistency with the **Sprint 1 Figma prototype**.
  * Ensure responsiveness is considered during Sprint 2 planning.

---

### 1.4 Developers

* All team members act as developers.
* Responsibilities:

  * Contribute to front-end and/or back-end development.
  * Participate in backlog refinement and estimation.
  * Commit code regularly and document contributions clearly.

---

## 2. Conduct Sprint 1 Retrospective (First Activity After Presentations)

Before planning Sprint 2, each group must conduct a **Sprint 1 Retrospective**.

### Format:

* [Use the **4Ls Retrospective**:](https://agilebox.app/blog/4ls-retrospective/)

  * **Liked**
  * **Learned**
  * **Lacked**
  * **Longed For**

### Requirements:

* Include both:

  * **Factual insights** (process, tools, collaboration)
  * **Emotional insights** (stress, confidence, motivation)
* Document the retrospective results and store them in GitHub.

---

## 3. Define Sprint 2 Goal

After the retrospective, the team must define a **Sprint 2 Goal**.

### Sprint Goal:

* A **single clear statement** describing what the team aims to achieve by the end of Sprint 2.
* The goal must align with:

  * Sprint 1 prototype
  * [Sprint 2 deliverables and Assessment criteria](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Project/blob/main/material/sprint2.md)
  

Example (for guidance):

> “By the end of Sprint 2, the team will deliver a working front-end and back-end structure aligned with the Sprint 1 prototype, including routing, mock data, and initial AI-related endpoints.”

---

## 4. Product Backlog Review and Creation

### 4.1 Product Backlog

* The Product Owner must ensure a **Product Backlog exists**.
* The Product Backlog should include:

  * ~~Features derived from the Sprint 1 prototype~~
  * Functional and technical requirements for the MERN application
  * Front-end, back-end, AI, and infrastructure-related items

If no Product Backlog exists, it **must be created today**.

---

## 5. Sprint 2 Backlog Creation

### 5.1 Extract Sprint 2 Backlog

* The Sprint 2 Backlog must be selected from the Product Backlog.
* Only items that contribute to **Sprint 2 deliverables** should be included.

Sprint 2 backlog items should cover:

* Front-end implementation
* Back-end implementation (including AI-related endpoints)


---

### 5.2 User Stories and Story Points (Mandatory)

All Sprint 2 backlog items must be written as **user stories** where applicable and **estimated using story points**.

#### User Story Format:

> *As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some value].*

#### Story Points:

* Use **story points** to estimate effort and complexity.
* Teams may use a simple scale such as:

  * 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
* Estimation should be done collaboratively by the team.
* Story points represent **relative effort**, not hours.

Each Sprint 2 backlog item must include:

* A short description or user story
* Assigned story points
* Responsible team member(s)

---

## 6. Tooling and Documentation (GitHub)

GitHub must be used to document and support Scrum activities.

Recommended documentation includes:

* Product Backlog
* Sprint 2 Backlog
* Sprint 1 Retrospective (4Ls)
* Scrum Master daily logs
* Evidence of team contributions (commits, issues)

The structure is flexible, but documentation must be **clear, accessible, and traceable**.
