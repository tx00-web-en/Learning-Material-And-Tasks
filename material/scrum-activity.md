# Activity: Scrum

### Part 1: INVEST Criteria

1. Review these [user stories](./scrum-part1.md) for an e-commerce website.
2. Assess how well each story meets the **INVEST** criteria:
   * Independent
   * Negotiable
   * Valuable
   * Estimable
   * Small
   * Testable
3. Compare your answers with [this reference](./scrum-part2.md).

### Part 2: Breaking Down User Stories into Tasks

* Review [this table](./scrum-part3.md), which shows examples of user stories mapped to their corresponding tasks.
* Consider the examples as a guide when start breaking down your own project’s user stories into actionable tasks.

### Part 3: Applying INVEST & DEEP to Your Project

* Review your project’s **product backlog** to ensure it follows the [**DEEP principle**](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Learning-Material-And-Tasks/blob/week2/material/scrum.md#deep-principle).
* Check that some of your project’s **user stories** also follow the [**INVEST criteria**](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Learning-Material-And-Tasks/blob/week2/material/scrum.md#invest).
