# Activity: Scrum

### Objective:

To gain a practical understanding of Scrum principles by reverse engineering a website and applying Scrum concepts to prototype development.

### Task 1: Reverse Engineering

1. **Website Exploration:**
   Please visit https://www.amazon.com/ to familiarize yourself with its functionalities.
    <!-- https://www.proshopdemo.dev/ or  -->

2. Instead of starting with user stories, you will deduce user stories after exploring the website. For instance, consider actions like registration and login.

Examples:

  - *As a user*, *I need* to receive personalized product recommendations based on my browsing and purchase history, *so that* I can discover relevant products I might be interested in.
  - *As a customer*, *I need* a simple and streamlined checkout process with clear steps, minimal form filling, and the option to review my order before finalizing it, *so that* I can complete my purchase easily and confidently.
  - *As a registered user*, *I need* to log in quickly using my email and password, *so that* I can have a secure and personalized shopping experience.
  - *As a new user*, *I need* to easily sign up for an account using my email and password, *so that* I can start shopping online.

### Task 2: 

Imagine you're going to build an app similar to Amazon.com:  
<!-- Work in groups and form a Scrum team. Each *group member* should choose one of the roles in Scrum.  -->

1. **Understanding the Roles:**
Discuss the role of the Product Owner within Scrum. What does a Product Owner do?

2. **Scrum Master's Necessity:**
Consider whether having a Scrum Master is required for this scenario.

3. **Creating User Stories:**
Collaborate to build the product backlog and define **more** user stories. Use the format: "As a ... , I need ..., so that ..."

4. **Sprint Backlog:**
Develop a sprint backlog by breaking user stories into tasks required for the prototype development.

5. **Understanding Burndown Chart:**
Discuss the meaning and significance of a burndown chart in the context of Scrum.

6. **Ceremonies Exploration:**
Discuss the three key Scrum ceremonies: sprint planning, daily scrum, and sprint review.

7.  **Backlog Clarification:**
Discuss the distinction between the product backlog and the sprint backlog.

### Task 3: Sprint 1 planning

Work with your team to **brainstorm and agree on a project idea**, then begin planning your first sprint. A detailed sample agenda is available [here](./group-agenda.md).

**Notes:**

* You can start Task 3 now and continue during the autonomous session in the afternoon.
* Effective collaboration within your team is essential for success.
* Apply critical thinking when defining and prioritizing **user stories**.
* Reflect on how Scrum principles apply to your planning.
* Distribute tasks by balancing individual strengths with opportunities for growth. 

**Expected Outcomes (by the end of Sprint 1 planning):**

* A clear **project idea** chosen by your group.
* An initial **Product Backlog** with user stories written.
* Established **Scrum roles**: decide who will serve as Product Owner and Scrum Master.
* A **Sprint Backlog** with tasks assigned based on team membersâ€™ strengths and development goals.
