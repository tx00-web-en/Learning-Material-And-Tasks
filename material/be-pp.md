# Pair Programming: Back end

The [pair programming task](./be-pp-current.md) will become visible once we start the session. In the meantime, you are strongly encouraged to review a task from a [previous period](./be-pp-old.md). This session’s pair programming activity will be **similar, though not identical**, and reflecting on earlier work will help you make the most of our time together.

Please also take a moment to review the group activities, watch the pre-session video, and revisit the task from the **previous period**.

* For the pair programming to be accepted, **both members must alternate iterations.**
  *Example:* Iteration 1 – Member 1, Iteration 2 – Member 2, Iteration 3 – Member 1, Iteration 4 – Member 2, and so on.
  Note that all commits will be graded separately.

* After each iteration, take a **screenshot** of the pushed commit on GitHub. The screenshot should clearly show both the **commit message** and the **user who made the commit**. Save all screenshots in a folder named **`screenshots`** within your repository.

* You may use the **Live Share** extension in VS Code to facilitate collaboration. However, commits must still alternate between members. It will **not** be considered pair programming if only one member is making all the commits.
