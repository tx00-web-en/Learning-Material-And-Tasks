## How We’re Forming Teams

To make sure teams are balanced, effective, and fun to work in, we’re using a simple and fair process based on your responses to the poll questions. Here’s how it works and why we’re doing it this way:

---

### **Step 1: Assigning Leaders**
- Every team needs someone to guide and keep things organized, so we’ll start by placing those who identified as leaders into separate teams. This ensures every group has someone ready to take charge.

### **Step 2: Adding Morale Boosters**
- To keep your team positive and motivated, we’re adding at least one person who sees themselves as a morale booster to every group. This person helps keep the team energized and working well together.

### **Step 3: Balancing Problem-Solvers and Creative Thinkers**
- Teams need both logical problem-solvers and creative idea people. We’ll spread these roles across teams so you’ll have someone who can troubleshoot challenges and another who brings fresh ideas.

### **Step 4: Mixing Technical Strengths**
- Some of you prefer designing beautiful interfaces (UI), while others like building the logic behind the scenes. We’ll pair these preferences to ensure each team has a good mix of technical skills.

### **Step 5: Matching Work Styles**
- Your preferences, such as what frustrates you most (e.g., bugs or unresponsive teammates) or whether you prefer dark mode or light mode, help us understand your work style. We’ll use this to match teammates who can work well together and avoid unnecessary conflict.

### **Step 6: Adding Shared Interests**
- To make working together more enjoyable, we’ll also consider your fun preferences (like snacks, time travel dreams, or reward choices) to group people who might click socially.

### **Why This Process?**
This method ensures each team has:
- A strong leader to guide the group.  
- A balance of technical and creative strengths.

- People with compatible work styles and shared interests.
- Diversity of Skills and Traits:

### **A Note on Hobbies and Preferences**  
While hobbies like gaming or working late can help fine-tune groups or make final adjustments for compatibility, they don't take precedence over leadership, technical focus, or teamwork styles. Instead, they’re more about ensuring your team enjoys working together and building camaraderie, rather than addressing the critical functional needs of the group.

Our primary focus is balancing skills, roles, and working styles to set every team up for success. However, we’ll also consider your fun preferences to make the experience enjoyable for everyone!
