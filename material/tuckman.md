# Tuckman's model of group development

Bruce Tuckman's model of group development outlines key stages that teams typically go through to become high-performing. Here's a brief overview of each stage:

## Stages

### 1. Forming
In this initial stage, team members are often **excited and optimistic** about the project. They are getting to know each other and **understanding the team's goals and structure**. There is usually **a lot of enthusiasm**, but also **some anxiety** about how they will fit into the team and what their roles will be.

### 2. Storming
This stage is marked by **conflict** and **competition** as individual **personalities and working styles emerge**. Team members may challenge each other and the team's goals, leading to **tension and disagreements**. It's a critical phase where the team **must work through conflicts** and establish a more cohesive way of working together.

### 3. Norming
During the norming stage, the **team starts to resolve its differences**, establish norms, and **develop stronger relationships.** Team members **begin to appreciate each other's strengths and work more collaboratively**. There is a greater sense of unity and **shared purpose.**

### 4. Performing
In this stage, the team is **functioning at a high level**. Members are **confident, motivated, and able to work independently and collaboratively.** The team is focused on achieving its goals and is highly productive. This stage is characterized by a **high degree of autonomy and effective problem-solving.**

5. **Adjourning**

> Understanding these stages can help teams navigate their development more effectively and become more productive and cohesive.

## Misc: About communication and miscommunication within the group:

While the Tuckman’s Model doesn’t explicitly say “miscommunication,” it’s **implied throughout**, especially in **Forming** and **Storming**, where unclear communication often causes tension.

Here’s how communication plays into each stage:

1. **Forming** – Communication is often **polite but cautious**. Team members are trying to understand their roles, so conversations may be surface-level. Miscommunication can happen because expectations and goals aren’t yet clear.

2. **Storming** – This stage is marked by **conflict and miscommunication**. Team members may challenge each other’s ideas, misunderstand intentions, or struggle with different communication styles. This is the phase where poor communication can lead to frustration, but it’s also where teams start to develop healthier dialogue.

3. **Norming** – Communication improves. Team members establish clearer norms, agree on processes, and learn how to **resolve misunderstandings constructively**. Trust and openness begin to grow.

4. **Performing** – Communication is **effective, transparent, and collaborative**. Miscommunication is minimal because the team has developed trust, shared understanding, and strong communication practices.

5. **Adjourning** – Communication shifts toward **reflection and closure**. Miscommunication can arise if members feel uncertain about next steps or unacknowledged in the wrap-up, but usually the focus is on celebration and feedback.
